This is a TOP (The Odin Project) project where a Landing Page website will be made. Here is the link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

Given a layout we need to make a Landing Page as close to the layout guidelines as we want. I took the liberty of changing it up a little bit into something I like. Used HTML and CSS for this project.
